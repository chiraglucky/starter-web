Apps like Outlook, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint have a built-in spell checker to make sure that important emails, projects, and presentations go out without embarrassing spelling mistakes. However, when using OneNote just to take personal notes, the spell checker isn't really a requirement.

If you only use OneNote for notes, such as for ideas, contact information, code snippets, and you have had enough of the red squiggly lines on content that wasn't recognized, you can disable the built-in spell checker whether you're using the Microsoft Store or classic version of the app, or even if you use OneNote on the web.

In this Windows 10 guide, we'll walk you through the steps to disable the spell checker in OneNote.
